# some try...except revision
# it's great for input validation!
# this version is cleaned up and has more comments
# compared to the life demo in the tutorial

# version 1: just some input validation
term = int(input("Input please:"))
# run this and enter a character and see what happens
#
print(term)
print("rest of program")

# version 2: do a try except
try:
   term = int(input("Input please:"))
   # enter a character, see what happens
except:
   pass
#
# print(term)
print("rest of program")

# version 3: print something useful in except
try:
   term = int(input("Input please:"))
   # enter a character, see what happens
except Exception as e:
   print(e)

# print(term)
print("rest of program")

# version 4: print something useful but also consider
# that you might not have been able to think about
# every eventuality that could go wrong
try:
   term = int(input("Input please:"))
   # enter a character, see what happens
except ValueError as ve:
   print("A value error has happened")
   print(ve)
   term = 0 # keep any future usage of term from
            # crashing the program if we ran into this
except Exception as e:
   print("I didn't realise this could happen")
   print(e)
   term = 0
#
print(term)
print("rest of program")

# raising errors to keep your functions save to use
def my_function(value):
   if value > 5:    # often used for business logic
       raise ValueError("this is not allowed")

# version 1: the crash
my_function(7) # this will crash

# version 2: the save exit
try:
   my_function(7)
except ValueError as ve:
   print(ve)
except Exception as e:
   print("This was unexpected")
   print(e)

# version 3: running into unexpected issues
# or forcing them (in this case)
def my_function(value):
   if value > 5:    # often used for business logic
       raise ValueError("this is not allowed")

   value/0  # this will force an exception because div by 0 is not allowed


try:
